# Hosting a static-website with AWS-S3
====================================

Hello folks,

**S3** is a well known storage service provided by AWS. Apart from that we can use the same S3 to host a static website.


In this example, we are hosting a static website with S3 and the website contents are served from a S3 bucket.

But the issue with this type static website hosting is that you can't directly install SSL for the website which is a huge concern regarding security. In this example we are serving the website using **Amazon Cloudfront** .Cloudfront is **CDN** service provided by amazon, and also we are securing our website with a SSL certificate generated by amazon itself.

For the time being it is supports in **us-east-1** .

so let's get started.

## Step 1 -Creation of S3 bucket


============================


First of all we need a S3 bucket to store our website contents.You can do the same by the following.

Login to AWS console, navigate to S3 services, click on create bucket.

![create bucket](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212608009-3021b141-3597-43d5-9e44-6029aaef6e31.png)

Add a name to your bucket, please note that the bucket name should be globally unique.in this example we are hosting our website as **mywebsite.antonyan.tech**, so we are naming the bucket in the same way, you can change the name as per your requirement, please remember that the name should be globally unique.

We don't need to add public access to the bucket, so we are keeping the default settings for the public access.

![public access](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212608147-a32af14a-6ec7-4945-881b-619962d17859.png)

You can add tags if required.leave the rest of the setting to the default values and create bucket.

## Step 2 -Adding website contents to bucket.

=====================================

Once a bucket is created, we can add the website contents to the bucket.In our example we are downloding the static website files from **tooplate.com**, a website with lots of html website templates.you can download the zip file to your local machine and once it fully downloaded extract the files.

Drag and drop the website files to the S3 bucket.

Once you upload the files, your bucket will be look like the following

![s3 bucket](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212608231-f56d13bc-6a18-4454-950a-a322bbd9554e.png)


## Step 3 -Generating SSL certificate

==========================



 if we enable static website hosting for the bucket with the bucket policy we will get the site as active, But as we mentioned before, the site won't be secured with SSL.So we are going to create a SSL certificate to our website, so that we can use this certificate while configuring our website with cloudfront.
 
 Navigate to **ACM** console in AWS, click on request.
 
 ![certificate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212608515-c93906ed-6e8e-4a93-ad90-6af26c9013bd.png)

 choose the certificate type as **public** certificate and add the domain names that you need to issue SSL certificate. you can also add ***.domain name**  as a wild card so that any subdomain you are creating under your domain will be having a SSL certificate.
 
 ![ssl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212608584-e9cfced0-8434-4126-b9c7-734a859ff7d2.png)

  Choose the validation method as **DNS**,then click on request.
 
 Once you requested the certificate,you have to complete the validation process.For that click on the ceritificate.and click the option for add records in route 53.and click on create records.Once the records are added it will take a few minutes for the DNS propagation, In the meantime we can setup the cloudfront distribution.
 
 ![ssl2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212608694-b717d465-3729-4f2c-9bdc-030272e9e34f.png)

 ## Step 4 -Setting up cloudfront distribution
 =================================
 
 
 
 Once the CNAME records are added we can proceed with setting up the CDN.
 
 Navigate to cloudfront management console.
 
 click on create distribution
 
 For origin domain,choose our s3 bucket from the dropdown list.
 
 Leave Origin path as blank, it is optional
 
 ![cf1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212608885-9b1c5ec9-5ed8-4ca0-9398-ddc92e5e88a7.png)

 While setting the origion access, use the option for Legacy access identities.To setup this we have to create a new OAI ,click on create OAI, and create.
 
 ![oai](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212608940-6fc7c02a-ec1a-40f6-b218-5906534dcf59.png)

 Once we created a new OAi, we need to update the bucket policy, click on option for automatically update the polcy and procced to bottom.choose the protocol policy as  Redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
 
 ![bucket policy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212608994-6d02a164-d5cb-4bac-a08a-b54409f1d4eb.png)

 You need to configure Cache key and origin requests with the recoomended option for s3 origins.
 
 For the Alternate domain name option, you need to add the domain which you need to point the distribution. In this example my static site is mywebiste.antonyan.tech, so we are proceeding with it.You can add the www version if required.
 
 ![CNAME](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212609060-4d20a23c-a731-48df-8f04-3f8c47e19ab2.png)

 
 Once it is added you need to configure the SSL certificate.in the Custom SSL certificate option,choose the SSL cerificate which we have generated for our website.set the Default root object as index.html.
 
 ![cert](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212609104-702ec1cb-cb7a-42bc-8e28-a7fbc8f13ce2.png)

 make sure that you have configured all the values correctly.once it is done, click on create distribution.It will take a few minutes to setup the distribution.
 
 ## Step 5 -creating route 53 record
 ========================
 
  Once the cloudfront distribution is up and running, we can point our domain to this cloudfront distribution.For that move to the console of route 53.
 choose the domain, click on add record.
 
 ![route 53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212609148-23b188fe-5b7b-484e-8811-61559349d910.png)

 add the subdomain, in our example, it is mywebsite.choose the record type as A.

 enable option of alias,choose alias to cloudfront distribution.choose our distribution and click on create record.
 
 ![route 53 -2png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61390678/212609196-be0a1df5-f4a0-4d68-aa45-497e77ef72ef.png)

 You have to wait for a few moment for the DNS propagation.
 
 Once it is propagated, we can access the website by mywebsite.antonyan.tech (In this example).
